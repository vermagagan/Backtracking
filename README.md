# Backtracking Practice Repository

Welcome to the Backtracking Practice Repository! Here, you'll find a collection of backtracking problems I've practiced to enhance my problem-solving skills.

## About Backtracking

Backtracking is a technique for systematically searching through all possible solutions to a problem. It incrementally builds a solution and backtracks when necessary.

## Support

If you encounter issues or have questions, open an issue in the repository, and I'll assist you.
